# DataStructureLib
This library has my implementations of basic data structures using C# 7.1 and .net core 2.1 for studies purposes.

## TO-DO
* [ ] Display the step-by-step of each sorting and search algorithm

## Collections:
* [x] Queue 
* [x] List
* [x] Stack
* [x] Unit test - XUnit

## Sort:
* [x] Mergesort
* [x] Heapsort 
* [x] Quicksort
* [x] Unit test - XUnit

## Search:
* [x] AVLtree: [x] Insert, [x] Search, [x] Remove
* [x] BinaryTree: [x] Insert, [x] Search, [x] Remove
* [x] HeapTree: [x] Insert, [x] Remove
* [x] BinarySearch (remember that it assumes that the entry is already ordered)
* [x] Graph - DeepFirstSearch
* [x] Graph - BreadFirstSearch
* [ ] Unit test - XUnit [WIP]
