# DataStructureLib
This library has my implementations of basic data structures using C# 7.1 and .net core 2.1 for studies purposes.

## TO-DO
* [ ] Unit test [WIP XUnit]
* [ ] Display the step-by-step of each sorting and search algorithm

## Collections:
* [x] Queue 
* [x] List
* [x] Stack

## Sort:
* [x] Mergesort
* [x] Heapsort 
* [x] Quicksort

## Tree/Search:
* [x] AVLtree: [x] Insert, [x] Search, [x] Remove
* [x] BinaryTree: [x] Insert, [x] Search, [x] Remove
* [x] HeapTree: [x] Insert, [x] Remove
* [x] BinarySearch (remember that it assumes that the entry is already ordered)
